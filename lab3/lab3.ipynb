    "The aforementioned vocabulary sizes are the one you will use in the task of character level language modelling (approx. 70), and for word level language models (commonly much larger than $10^5$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial hyperparameters are the hidden layer size of 100, an unroll of 30 timesteps and a learning rate of 1e-1. You should try out some other hyperparameters as well and report on loss and sample convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the recurrent neural network can be split conceptually into four parts, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.1: Parameter initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter matrices should be initialized randomly from a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 1e-2. The bias vectors should be initialized to zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter initializtion code could look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def __init__(self, hidden_size, sequence_length, vocab_size, learning_rate):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to add a redundant dimension while initializing bias vectors for numpy broadcasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.2: Forward pass\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward pass of the recurrent neural network can be imagined as a loop in which we iteratively perform a single timestep. The forward pass can therefore be implemented as a function which processes a single timestep, and a function which iterates over the whole sequence and stores the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The skeletons of the aforementioned functions could look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def rnn_step_forward(self, x, h_prev, U, W, b):\n",
    "    ...\n",

    "def rnn_forward(self, x, h0, U, W, b):\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that even though the parameters U, W and b exist as instance variables of the class (self.U, self.W, self.b), due to reproducibility we redundantly leave them as arguments of the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.3: Backward pass\n",
    "\n",
    "The backward pass of the recurrent network is conceptually similar to the forward pass with the iteration being done in reverse, from the last timestep towards the first one. The backward pass is done by the backpropagation through time algorithm (BPTT). The skeletons of the BPTT algorithm functions could look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def rnn_step_backward(self, grad_next, cache):\n",
    "    ...\n",

    "```\n",

    "In order to mitigate the exploding gradient problem, before applying the accumulated gradient, apply elementwise gradient clipping. We recommend you use the `np.clip()` method, and leave the values in the interval of $[âˆ’5,5]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.4: Training loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The training loop connects the recurrent network with the input data, calculates the loss and does parameter optimization. Ideally, the network should be idependent of the data - so it is recommended to separate the iteration over batches and epochs from the network class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A skeleton implementation of the loss computation function could look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def output(h, V, c):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "def output_loss_and_grads(self, h, V, c, y):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the parameter learning function could look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def update(self, dU, dW, db, dV, dc,\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the control flow loop and iterating the optimization process could look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def run_language_model(dataset, max_epochs, hidden_size=100, sequence_length=30, learning_rate=1e-1, sample_every=100)\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `step` function, whose skeleton is not described, contains the logic of running a single forward and backward pass of a neural network on a minibatch of inputs. As inputs, the method accepts an initial hidden state vector, the one-hot encoded inputs and outputs of shapes BxTxV, where B is the minibatch size, T the number of timesteps to unroll the network for and V the size of the vocabulary. As outputs we receive the loss in that step as well as the hidden state from the last timestep, which should then be used as the next initial hidden state.\n",
